	<h1>Location</h1>

	<p>Moscow is an 860-year-old iconic, global city, which has played a central role in the development of Russia and the
		world, as the capital of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and, today, the Russian Federation.
	</p>
	<p>For many, the sight of the Kremlin complex in the centre of the city is still loaded with symbolism and history.

	</p>
	<p>Today, Moscow is a thriving, exuberant capital city that overflows with life, culture and sometimes traffic. A
		sprawling metropolis, Moscow is home to numerous museums, Soviet-era monoliths and post-Soviet kitsch, but continues
		to pave the way forward as Muscovites move into the 21st century.
